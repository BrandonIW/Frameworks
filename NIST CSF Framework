###-Overview
The NIST Framework is guidance based on existing standards to help organizations better manage and reduce risk. It was an executive order in 2013, and NIST was tasked with its creation. It had some original criteria such as:
1) Must be technology neutral, meanining no vendor-specific shit
2) Guidance for measuring the performance of implementing the Framework
3) Allows orgs to ID areas for improvement 
4) Must be flexible and account for massive differences between organizations
5) Help owners, non-technical ppl identify and assess cyber risk

It is organized into 3 primary components:

1) Framework Core
2) Implementation Tiers
3) Profiles

#TODO - Example subcategories

####- Framework Core -#####
Key functions to provide a lifecycle of cyber management. It is meant to use simplistic language to enable communication b/t multi-diciplinary teams. The Core is split into 5 FUNCTIONS, each having multiple CATEGORIES, further split into SUBCATEGORIES. The SUBCATEGORIES are OUTCOME DRIVEN, meaning they do not mandate HOW and organization achieves these outcomes, only that they are achieved, allowing the framework to be flexible. Each SUBCATEGORY is also acommpanied by informative references to technical explanations as to how these subcategory may be achieved. 

---> FUNCTIONS:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

###-Identify
Development of an orangizational understanding to manage cyber risk to systems, assets, data etc. Basically, we need to understand our own company before we can protect the company.

1) Asset Management: Keep inventory/spreadsheet of all our hardware and software, so we can keep track of entry points for attackers. This also includes staff that may be critical for specific funtions
- Do we know how many endpoint devices we have?
- Do we know what technicians are able to use this critical software?
- Communication and data flows w/i the org are mapped
- Assets (hardware, s/w, personnel) are prioritized based on their criticality

2) Business Enviornment: What is the most important activities that provide critical functioning for the company? 
- What do ppl need from us? 
- What our business goals? 
- What is our org's role in the larger supply chain?
- What are the dependencies for critical functions that we offer, and how are they delivered?

3) Governance: ID Policies and procedures and any legal requirements in our cyber program. e.g. 
- Do we need MFA?
- What is our password complexity level required for our superusers?
- Medical data backups must be kept for 40 years oe w/e. 
- Identify roles/responsibilities of users/super-users/external stakeholders. What are their responsiblities? 

4) Risk Assessment: Helping us understand what risks we have in our envionrment. Identification of IMPACT and LIKLIHOOD of risks. i.e. meteor vs ransomware
- Do we have a patch management system? 
- Do we do vuln. scanning. 
- Are we actively getting new information/keeping up-to-date via forums and stuff
- Identification of threats, and their potential impact and liklihood
- ID our "risk" value, based on impact and likelihoods 

5) Risk Management Stragtegy: Identification of the controls and protections and strategies to protect the risk data we have. This doesn't cover the actual protection, but rather just the identification of these strategeies and that they exist.  
- What is our risk tolerance? 
- What processes do we have in place to deal with risk data? 

6) Supply Chain Risk Management: Identification of suppliers 
- Who are our suppliers
- What external partieies have access to our network
- Have we assessed the 3rd parties 
- If we access other ppl's supply-chain, as a consumer, are we protected from them? 
- Are we assessing third -party suppliers using audits and stuff to confirm they're meeting contracual obligations? 

###-Protect
Development and implementation of safeguards to ensure services function
1) Identity Management, Authentication & Access: 
- Unqiue accounts per employee
- Properly configured ACLs
- Security Groups
- Remote access is secured 
- Physical access is secured
- Network segregation 

2) Awareness and Training:
- Layer 8 issue 

3) Data security
- At-rest encryption / in-transit encryption
- There is capacity to ensure availablity of services can be maintained (i.e. retina axis server lol)
- Integrity checking for software, firmware (hashing)
- Development and testing environments are separate

4) Information Protection Processes and Procedures:
- Do we have a baseline configuration of IT to promote high security i.e. all unecessary services are turned off etc. i.e. concept of least functionality. Svrs/workstattions etc. only do what they need to do, and nothing else
- Change control in place to properly go through Change mangement steps
- Backups are taken, tested, and maintained
- Data is securely destroyed if no longer needed 
- IR and Busicness Continuity response plans are in place

5) Maintenance:
- Who is performing maintenance and repair of assets?
- Are these reparations logged
- Remote maintenance is not possible unless authorized

6) Protective Technology: 
- There are audits that are documented and reviewed
- Removeable media is protected and restricted
- Principle of least functionality 
- Redundancy is in place, i.e. hotswappable, load balancers, failsafe's etc. 


###-Detect
Develop tools/policies to detect cybersecurity events
1) Anonmalies and Events:
- Understand your network's baseline/"normal" traffic. If you know how your enterprise normally functions, you are more likely to recognize anonmalies. What is your "known good"
- Detected events can be analyzed to undrstand wtf is happening
- Event data is collected and correlated from multiple different sources

2) Continuous monitoring:
- The network is constantly monitored to detect potential cyber events
- The physical environment is monitored
- Malicious code is detected
- Unauthorized personelle, devices, and software is monitored
- Vulernability scans performed

3) Detection Processes:
- Detection processes are tested
- Detection process are continuously improved
- Who is monitoring/assigned to detection? Do they know their responsibilities?
- When detected, is it communicated properly to the right ppl?



###-Respond
The ability to take action against a cyber event

1) Response Planning
We've detected smth has gone wrong:
- What is our response plan (i.e. we have firedrills so we know what needs to be done)

2) Communications
- Personnel know their roles and order of operations whena  response is needed
- Who do we need to tell?
- There is coordination with stakeholders when response plans are executed

3) Analysis
- Notifications from detection systems are investigated
- Impact of the incident is investigated
- Forensics performed
- Incidents are categorized

4) Mitigation
- Incidents are contained
- Incidents are mitigateed
- Any newly identified vuls. are mitigated and documented as accepted risks
- Identification of "why" this occured

5) Improvements
- Lessons learned. Is our response plan good enough, after the dust has settled?
- Response strategies are updated. Maybe we didn't expect this person to be on vacation, and he got the notification. So we need to update the process to ensure we have a 2nd person, for example



###-Recover
1) Recovery Planning
- Recovery plan is executed during or after a cyber incident 

2) Improvements
- Recovery plans incorporate lessons learned and are updated

3) Communications
- Public relations are managed (who's talking to twitter comments and media etc.) 
- Reputation is repaired after an incident
- Recovery activities are communicated to internal and external stakeholders, and executives. 

Develop and implement the ability to restore capabilities of a service that was impaired due to a cyber event
- Ensure recovery plans are updated - As with response plans, testing execution of the recovery plan to train employees and highlight areas for improvement
- Management public relations & reputation - Consider how you will manage public relations so that your information sharing is accurate, complete for the public, but also minimize dmg to company reputation. 



####- Implementation Tiers -#####
Tiers refer to the degree to which an org's cybersecurity risk management practices rigorously bend to the characteristics defined by the Framework. i.e. what level do we need to implment this? Heavily implemented into our system, or partially, or we don't care. 

Tier 1 - Partial
- Your org. has an Ad. Hoc risk management (on the fly, no processes in place to manage it)
- Limited cybersecurity risk awareness. Are you aware of the newest Wannacry varient? Are you aware of newest vulnerabilities etc. 
- Low external resource participation (Do you participate in webinars and shit, are you part of any orgs. etc. are you sharing informtion w/ others) 

Tier 2 - Risk informed
- Some risk management practices 
- You're aware of the newest threats but don't really have a program to address them 
- Information external participation

Tier 3 - Repeatable
- Formalized risk management 
- Organization-wide program to address new risks 
- Recives external partner information but doesn't share 

Tier 4 - Adaptive
- ADaptive risk management practices 
- Cultural risk informed program  
- Actively shares information with others 


High tiers are NOT mandatory. But rather the tiers chosen should reflect the organization's goals and feasability, such as finanical fesability



####- Profiles -#####
A profile is sort of an organization's alignment of their own requirements, objectives, risk appetites, & resources, against their DESIRED outcome from following the Framework Core. An organization, for example, may have a "Current" profile, but they want to meet a specific "Target" profile. 

Profiles function to optimize/fine-tune the Framework to best serve that specific organization. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to meet the framework. It depends on the org. For example, we could have the below, which maps our subcategories we want to meet (TARGET PROFILE) , and the size of the gap (what we currently have i.e. CURRENT STATE PROFILE vs. what we want TARGET PROFILE) to meet that subcategory, the priority of that subcategory and the budget available to meet it. 

Subcategory | Priority | Gaps | Budget | 
1           | High     | Small| $$$    |
2           | Low      | Large| $      |
3           | Moderate | Med  | $      |
4           | High     | Small| $$     | 



###-Uses & Benefits from the Framework
Again, the framework provides sort of a common language that is simplistic, easy to follow, and malleable to each organization's needs. The Framework Profiles can be useful for identifying where an organization falls short, for example, and needs improvement. 

BASICALLY THE FRAMEWORK ALLOWS FOR STRONGER/EASIER COMMUNICATION OF ASPECTS OF CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT TO ALL PERSONELLE OF AN ORG. IT GETS THE POINTS ACCROSS w/o JARGON to VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS/EMPLOYEES. THE TIERS CAN ALSO BE USED TO GET CONTEXT ON THAT ORGANIZATION'S LEVEL OF PRIORITY GIVEN TO A PARTICULAR RISK. DO THEY CARE, MAYBE NOT RLY? THE TIERS ARE A COMMUNICATION TOOL TO DISCUSS STUFF WITH THE ORGANIZATION.

The framework is scalable (because it is NOT outcome driven, so org's can meet it as best they can, using what resources they have) Both a large and small org can approach a subcategory/outcome in a manner that is feasible for them. Flexiblity. 

---> Example Communication Path the Framework Takes:
1) Starts w/ Senior Executive Level - Executives need to assess what are the org's ultimate mission goals, priorities etc. They choose the tiers to be selected. 
What is our risk appetite? 
What is our budget? 

2) Buisness and Process Levels - Translation layer between operational/implementation & senior exe's who don't know wtf they're doing. 
- How does the organization's overall objectives, how does that translate to our individual business/processes, i.e. Websites, Databases, etc. 
- Creation of a framework profile 
- Collects feedback from Implemenation and Operations Levels, and reports changes to current and future risk to senior executives 

3) Operational Levels - Focus on actually doing the work to implement changes to secure infrastrucuture. 
- May assess the implementation and feedback into Business & Process Levels.

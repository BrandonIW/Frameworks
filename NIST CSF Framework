###-Overview
The NIST Framework is guidance based on existing standards to help organizations better manage and reduce risk. It was an executive order in 2013, and NIST was tasked with its creation. It had some original criteria such as:
1) Must be technology neutral, meanining no vendor-specific shit
2) Guidance for measuring the performance of implementing the Framework
3) Allows orgs to ID areas for improvement 
4) Must be flexible and account for massive differences between organizations
5) Help owners, non-technical ppl identify and assess cyber risk

It is organized into 3 primary components:

1) Framework Core
2) Implementation Tiers
3) Profiles

#TODO - Example subcategories

####- Framework Core -#####
Key functions to provide a lifecycle of cyber management. It is meant to use simplistic language to enable communication b/t multi-diciplinary teams. The Core is split into 5 FUNCTIONS, each having multiple CATEGORIES, further split into SUBCATEGORIES. The SUBCATEGORIES are OUTCOME DRIVEN, meaning they do not mandate HOW and organization achieves these outcomes, only that they are achieved, allowing the framework to be flexible. Each SUBCATEGORY is also acommpanied by informative references to technical explanations as to how these subcategory may be achieved. 

---> FUNCTIONS:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

###-Identify
Development of an orangizational understanding to manage cyber risk to systems, assets, data etc. Basically, we need to understand our own company before we can protect the company.

1) Asset Management: Keep inventory/spreadsheet of all our hardware and software, so we can keep track of entry points for attackers. This also includes staff that may be critical for specific funtions
- Do we know how many endpoint devices we have?
- Do we know what technicians are able to use this critical software?

2) Business Enviornment: What is the most important activities that provide critical functioning for the company? 
- What do ppl need from us? 
- What our business goals? 

3) Governance: ID Policies and procedures and any legal requirements in our cyber program. e.g. 
- Do we need MFA?
- What is our password complexity level required for our superusers?
- Medical data backups must be kept for 40 years oe w/e. Also identifies roles/responsibilities of users/super-users/external stakeholders. What are their responsiblities? 

4) Risk Assessment: Helping us understand what risks we have in our envionrment. Identification of IMPACT and LIKLIHOOD of risks. i.e. meteor vs ransomware
- Do we have a patch management system? 
- Do we do vuln. scanning. 

5) Risk Management Stragtegy: Identification of the controls and protections and strategies to protect the risk data we have. This doesn't cover the actual protection, but rather just the identification of these strategeies and that they exist.  

6) Supply Chain Risk Management: Identification of suppliers 
- Who are our suppliers
- What external partieies have access to our network
- If we access other ppl's supply-chain, as a consumer, are we protected from them? 

###-Protect
Development and implementation of safeguards to ensure services function
1) Manage access to assets and info - Unique accounts per employee. Effective ACLs. Security Groups used appropriately. 
2) Protect sensitive data - i.e. in-transit and at-rest encryption of data. Data is securely destroyed after no more need of it
3) Regular backups - Keep a backup offline & offset
4) Protect end-devices - Host-based F/W, A/V etc., disable unecessary services etc.
5) Management of vulnerabilities - Patching, vulnerability scanners
6) Train users - Layer 8 issues

###-Detect
Develop tools/policies to detect cybersecurity events
1) Test and update detection processes - Develop and test processes and procedures for detected cyber events.  
2) Monitoring of logs - Logs are needed to ID anonmalies. Can be used to detect changes to accounts, permissions, or new communication channels
3) Understand your network's baseline/"normal" traffic - If you know how your enterprise normally functions, you are more likely to recognize anonmalies 
4) Understanding impact of a cyber event - Ensure you can quikcly understand the breadth and depth of the impact of a cyber event 

###-Respond
The ability to take action against a cyber event
1) Ensure response plans are tested
2) Ensure response plans are updated
3) Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders - Our response plans should include external stakeholders as they may be able to contribute to improving the plan and execution. I think this means things like vendors and such we work with? 

###-Recover
Develop and implement the ability to restore capabilities of a service that was impaired due to a cyber event
- Ensure recovery plans are updated - As with response plans, testing execution of the recovery plan to train employees and highlight areas for improvement
- Management public relations & reputation - Consider how you will manage public relations so that your information sharing is accurate, complete for the public, but also minimize dmg to company reputation. 



####- Implementation Tiers -#####
Tiers refer to the degree to which an org's cybersecurity risk management practices rigorously bend to the characteristics defined by the Framework. i.e. what level do we need to implment this? Heavily implemented into our system, or partially, or we don't care. 

Tier 1 - Partial
- Your org. has an Ad. Hoc risk management (on the fly, no processes in place to manage it)
- Limited cybersecurity risk awareness. Are you aware of the newest Wannacry varient? Are you aware of newest vulnerabilities etc. 
- Low external resource participation (Do you participate in webinars and shit, are you part of any orgs. etc. are you sharing informtion w/ others) 

Tier 2 - Risk informed
- Some risk management practices 
- You're aware of the newest threats but don't really have a program to address them 
- Information external participation

Tier 3 - Repeatable
- Formalized risk management 
- Organization-wide program to address new risks 
- Recives external partner information but doesn't share 

Tier 4 - Adaptive
- ADaptive risk management practices 
- Cultural risk informed program  
- Actively shares information with others 


High tiers are NOT mandatory. But rather the tiers chosen should reflect the organization's goals and feasability, such as finanical fesability



####- Profiles -#####
A profile is sort of an organization's alignment of their own requirements, objectives, risk appetites, & resources, against their DESIRED outcome from following the Framework Core. An organization, for example, may have a "Current" profile, but they want to meet a specific "Target" profile. 

Profiles function to optimize/fine-tune the Framework to best serve that specific organization. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to meet the framework. It depends on the org. For example, we could have the below, which maps our subcategories we want to meet (TARGET PROFILE) , and the size of the gap (what we currently have i.e. CURRENT STATE PROFILE vs. what we want TARGET PROFILE) to meet that subcategory, the priority of that subcategory and the budget available to meet it. 

Subcategory | Priority | Gaps | Budget | 
1           | High     | Small| $$$    |
2           | Low      | Large| $      |
3           | Moderate | Med  | $      |
4           | High     | Small| $$     | 



###-Uses & Benefits from the Framework
Again, the framework provides sort of a common language that is simplistic, easy to follow, and malleable to each organization's needs. The Framework Profiles can be useful for identifying where an organization falls short, for example, and needs improvement. 

BASICALLY THE FRAMEWORK ALLOWS FOR STRONGER/EASIER COMMUNICATION OF ASPECTS OF CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT TO ALL PERSONELLE OF AN ORG. IT GETS THE POINTS ACCROSS w/o JARGON to VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS/EMPLOYEES. THE TIERS CAN ALSO BE USED TO GET CONTEXT ON THAT ORGANIZATION'S LEVEL OF PRIORITY GIVEN TO A PARTICULAR RISK. DO THEY CARE, MAYBE NOT RLY? THE TIERS ARE A COMMUNICATION TOOL TO DISCUSS STUFF WITH THE ORGANIZATION.

The framework is scalable (because it is NOT outcome driven, so org's can meet it as best they can, using what resources they have) Both a large and small org can approach a subcategory/outcome in a manner that is feasible for them. Flexiblity. 

---> Example Communication Path the Framework Takes:
1) Starts w/ Senior Executive Level - Executives need to assess what are the org's ultimate mission goals, priorities etc. They choose the tiers to be selected. 
What is our risk appetite? 
What is our budget? 

2) Buisness and Process Levels - Translation layer between operational/implementation & senior exe's who don't know wtf they're doing. 
- How does the organization's overall objectives, how does that translate to our individual business/processes, i.e. Websites, Databases, etc. 
- Creation of a framework profile 
- Collects feedback from Implemenation and Operations Levels, and reports changes to current and future risk to senior executives 

3) Operational Levels - Focus on actually doing the work to implement changes to secure infrastrucuture. 
- May assess the implementation and feedback into Business & Process Levels.

###-Overview
The NIST Framework is guidance based on existing standards to help organizations better manage and reduce risk. It was an executive order in 2013, and NIST was tasked with its creation. It had some original criteria such as:
1) Must be technology neutral, meanining no vendor-specific shit
2) Guidance for measuring the performance of implementing the Framework
3) Allows orgs to ID areas for improvement 
4) Must be flexible and account for massive differences between organizations
5) Help owners, non-technical ppl identify and assess cyber risk

It is organized into 3 primary components:

1) Framework Core
2) Implementation Tiers
3) Profiles


####- Framework Core -#####
Key functions to provide a lifecycle of cyber management. It is meant to use simplistic language to enable communication b/t multi-diciplinary teams. The Core is split into 5 FUNCTIONS, each having multiple CATEGORIES, further split into SUBCATEGORIES. The SUBCATEGORIES are OUTCOME DRIVEN, meaning they do not mandate HOW and organization achieves these outcomes, only that they are achieved, allowing the framework to be flexible. Each SUBCATEGORY is also acommpanied by informative references to technical explanations as to how these subcategory may be achieved. 

---> FUNCTIONS:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

###-Identify
Development of an orangizational understanding to manage cyber risk to systems, assets, data etc. Basically, we need to understand our own company 
1) Identify critical enterprise processes and assets - What is the most important activities that provide critical functioning for the company?
2) Documentation information flows - Where data is located, and where it flows, from place to place. Where is our data stored and how is it communicated with external partners for example
3) Maintain hardware/software inventory (Asset Management) - Keep inventory/spreadsheet of all our hardware and software, so we can keep track of entry points for attackers
4) Establish Cyber Policies (Governance program) - ID Policies and procedures that describe how cybersecurity acitivites will protect information and systems. i.e. Everyone must use MFA, Passwords have ___ level of complexity etc.
5) Identify threats, vulnerabilities and risk to assets - Ensure risk management processes are established and documented in risk registrars 

###-Protect
Development and implementation of safeguards to ensure services function
1) Manage access to assets and info - Unique accounts per employee. Effective ACLs. Security Groups used appropriately. 
2) Protect sensitive data - i.e. in-transit and at-rest encryption of data. Data is securely destroyed after no more need of it
3) Regular backups - Keep a backup offline & offset
4) Protect end-devices - Host-based F/W, A/V etc., disable unecessary services etc.
5) Management of vulnerabilities - Patching, vulnerability scanners
6) Train users - Layer 8 issues

###-Detect
Develop tools/policies to detect cybersecurity events
1) Test and update detection processes - Develop and test processes and procedures for detected cyber events.  
2) Monitoring of logs - Logs are needed to ID anonmalies. Can be used to detect changes to accounts, permissions, or new communication channels
3) Understand your network's baseline/"normal" traffic - If you know how your enterprise normally functions, you are more likely to recognize anonmalies 
4) Understanding impact of a cyber event - Ensure you can quikcly understand the breadth and depth of the impact of a cyber event 

###-Respond
The ability to take action against a cyber event
1) Ensure response plans are tested
2) Ensure response plans are updated
3) Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders - Our response plans should include external stakeholders as they may be able to contribute to improving the plan and execution. I think this means things like vendors and such we work with? 

###-Recover
Develop and implement the ability to restore capabilities of a service that was impaired due to a cyber event
- Ensure recovery plans are updated - As with response plans, testing execution of the recovery plan to train employees and highlight areas for improvement
- Management public relations & reputation - Consider how you will manage public relations so that your information sharing is accurate, complete for the public, but also minimize dmg to company reputation. 



####- Implementation Tiers -#####
Tiers refer to the degree to which an org's cybersecurity risk management practices rigorously bend to the characteristics defined by the Framework. 

Tier 1 - Partial
Tier 2 - Risk informed
Tier 3 - Repeatable
Tier 4 - Adaptive

High tiers are NOT mandatory. But rather the tiers chosen should reflect the organization's goals and feasability, such as finanical fesability



####- Profiles -#####
A profile is sort of an organization's alignment of their own requirements, objectives, risk appetites, & resources, against their DESIRED outcome from following the Framework Core. An organization, for example, may have a "Current" profile, but they want to meet a specific "Target" profile. 

Profiles function to optimize/fine-tune the Framework to best serve that specific organization. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to meet the framework. It depends on the org. For example, we could have the below, which maps our subcategories we want to meet, and the size of the gap (what we currently have vs. what we want) to meet that subcategory, the priority of that subcategory and the budget available to meet it. 

Subcategory | Priority | Gaps | Budget | 
1           | High     | Small| $$$    |
2           | Low      | Large| $      |
3           | Moderate | Med  | $      |
4           | High     | Small| $$     | 



###-Uses & Benefits from the Framework
Again, the framework provides sort of a common language that is simplistic, easy to follow, and malleable to each organization's needs. The Framework Profiles can be useful for identifying where an organization falls short, for example, and needs improvement. 

BASICALLY THE FRAMEWORK ALLOWS FOR STRONGER/EASIER COMMUNICATION OF ASPECTS OF CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT TO ALL PERSONELLE OF AN ORG. IT GETS THE POINTS ACCROSS w/o JARGON to VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS/EMPLOYEES. THE TIERS CAN ALSO BE USED TO GET CONTEXT ON THAT ORGANIZATION'S LEVEL OF PRIORITY GIVEN TO A PARTICULAR RISK. DO THEY CARE, MAYBE NOT RLY? THE TIERS ARE A COMMUNICATION TOOL TO DISCUSS STUFF WITH THE ORGANIZATION.

The framework is scalable (because it is NOT outcome driven, so org's can meet it as best they can, using what resources they have) Both a large and small org can approach a subcategory/outcome in a manner that is feasible for them. Flexiblity. 

---> Example usages:
1) Assess your current state of operations (What is a prioirty, review existing politices, identify vulnerabilities and risks)
2) Build a target state. "I want to meet these specific goals"
3) Build a roadmap with budgets and activities you will pursue to meet that target state.
